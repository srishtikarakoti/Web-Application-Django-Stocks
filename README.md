# Web-Application-Django_Stocks

I designed a web application to keep track of my stock portfolio. It has 3 views.

View 1 (Get Stock Quote): 
- Purpose of this view is to explore different companies and see how they are trending. In the future I'd like to add news articles to this view as well. 
- Gives an output of data for a given company 

View 2 (Add Stock to Portfolio): 
- Purpose of this view is to add company to the table once you have bought shares in that company. Once you have done the market research in view one, you can add your stock to the table in this view to keep track. 
- Adds stock to a table 

View 3 (Delete): - Purpose of this view is to delete any company name from the table in view 2
